# BloodGroup_Detection_using_HandImages
This was my major project done in B.Tech final year. The idea behind the project was detecting the blood group of a person by using hand images scanned by using sensors. By using Image processing Technique blood group is detected by processing the hand spectrum images. Here we can detect the blood group of a person without using blood samples.
